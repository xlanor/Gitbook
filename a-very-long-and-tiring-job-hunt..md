# A very long and tiring job hunt.

I've recently signed an offer from Bloomberg London and came to an end of a job hunt!

During this entire process, I've learnt alot about what I knew, what I didn't know, and what to avoid when looking for a job.



Firstly: Recruiters are very very important. Pick a good recruiter that you can work with.

I was very fortunate to be placed with Bradley on the recruiting team from London at Bloomberg, and Aysel from Yelp in London for my interviews at Yelp.

These two recruiters were the nicest recruiters that I met in my current job hunt and had no issues responding to queries and expediting the entire process once I received my first offer. I'd highly reccomend connecting with them on LinkedIn if you are looking to join either firms.

There were some recruiters from general headhunting firms that were very, very rude.

I was outright told that "I shouldnt consider a full time role, just take a contract role". Of course, this was because the recruiter's current avaliable roleswere all... contract roles. This was after I explictly explained that I wanted a full time position at a place where I envisioned myself staying for the next five years - I dont think that I'm currently at the point where job-hopping gets me further, as I've already touched various part of the stack and know what I want to focus on at this point.

A good recruiter understands when a candidate is a good fit for their role (or isn't a good fit). The better recruiters I met locally (Maria from IBM, Grace from Bytedance, Clara from MS Consultancy) were incredibly professional when I explained that I was actually exploring overseas opportunities at this point in time, or that the skillset they were looking for was not particularly suited to the jobs that they had on hand.

This was in contrast to some recruiters who outright insulted me when I thanked them for their time and told them that I was not very interested in the postings that they had avaliable.



Secondly, DYOR on the JD that you're applying for. Know the role, do some research on blind to see the culture of the team, leetcode discussions to get a hang of the interview process, glassdoor to take a look at generalised role interviews for that firm.

Your recruiter may not always give you the most accurate information - prepare the best way that you can. I have honestly never used any recruiter's information to prep for interviews, because I do not expect them to be able to provide technical  specifics.&#x20;

However, usually when you get a recruiter's email with the interviewer's name, you should go to LinkedIn to look at what kind of position and team your interviewer is currently in. Chances are, he will ask about things that you are working on - that he knows about.
