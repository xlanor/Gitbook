# Introduction

I've been sending out my applications to firms recently and have gotten through all of the initial hackerrank screens.&#x20;

It's been a fairly interesting process so far, and I've seen some fairly interesting questions throughout the entire process. What's probably more interesting is the solutions I've seen in the leetcode discuss sections, so I decided to jot down my own explanations so that I don't have to re-understand the solutions when I'm revising leetcode again.

Although I applied for mainly SRE positions, as opposed to SWE, where you tend to get the broad spectrum of fucked up questions, there's been one or two companies (looking at you, China Tech) where the coding rounds for an SRE is no different from that of an SWE.

Sometimes, I will probably use this space to do additional blogging about myinfrastructure/homelab
