# The Framework laptop

Recently, I started job hunting for a new job. As I currently do not have a device beyond my existing work laptop, I was looking for a new laptop that I could dedicate for schoolwork and some light coding/work on the go.

I instinctively took a look at the latest Apple Macs (and promptly listened to my wallet and closed the page). Apart from the price range, which was borderline ridiculous, the biggest issue for me was also the fact that the CPU relies on an entirely different architecture, and that VMs provided for my coursework may not necessarily be able to run on the CPU.

For instance, I was considering taking HPCA as one of my core modules. The VMs have not been updated in over ten years (according to the comments I saw on Ed). I didn't want to spend time struggling with this.

This meant that I was left to look at a laptop that had ootb support for any linux distributions (I'm fairly dist agnostic).

I looked at a few competitors like the System76 laptops, Thinkpads, and Dell's XPS line.

Ultimately, I decided that Framework's vision of the right to repair was in line with what I personally supported, the fact that I already had a few SSDs and SODIMM rams picked up on Black Friday (or Carousell) lying around was also a huge contributing factor.

This was a big risk, because I would be shipping it through a forwarder to Singapore. If there was any issues at customs due to the battery included in the laptop, I would be left high and dry without any official support from Framework.

In addition, I would also not have any local warranty for the laptop.

However, I still decided to go ahead for the following reasons

* There are existing parts that are compatible with Framework already showing up on Aliexpress. The entire screen can be replaced for a little over a hundred dollars.
* Usually, when laptops go, it's mostly either the SSD, or a cracked screen, or a depressed key in the keyboard, or the touchpad, or the battery.
* All of these parts are easily removable. The only one that I might have issues with shipping through customs may be the battery, but I've bought enough laptop batteries on ebay to be confident in the fact that it should clear customs with no issues.
* I'm relocating for work anyway so a local warranty means nothing to me.
* I'm fairly experienced with DIY repair and simply replacing a few components when they break should not be a problem for me.
* Even in the event that framework goes out of business, I'm confident that third party replacement parts (except for niche parts like the fingerprint reader) would be avaliable over time.
* I already had the parts avaliable (I always buy a few SSDs on hand in case my server SSDs fail, and I had quite a few SODIMM ddr4 rams leftover from my kube node clusters)

There's already plenty of unboxing/initial setup of the Framework, so I'm not going to go into those. Let me show the total costs here

|                                                        |                            |   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | - |
| <p>DIY Edition<br>(i7 mid-tier, no storage/ssd/os)</p> | 1.4k SGD, claimed 500 SGD  |   |
| Samsung 970 EVO 1tb black                              | 140 SGD                    |   |
| SK Hynix 32gb x2 3200Mhz SODIMM                        | 350 SGD                    |   |
| Import and shipping (standard ezbuy)                   | 120 ish SGD                |   |

Overall, the total bill came up to just shy of 2,000. I feel that for an upgradeable laptop, this is a very reasonable price.

Upon receiving the laptop, I installed Fedora on the laptop.&#x20;

One thing I was pretty amazed by was that the entire laptop pretty much worked OOTB.

I didn't have to do anything funny to get my fingerprint scanner working, or my bluetooth
